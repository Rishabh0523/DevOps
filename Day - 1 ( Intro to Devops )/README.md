##  What is Devops ?

DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams. It emphasizes team empowerment, cross-team communication and collaboration, and technology automation.
In simple terms, DevOps is about removing the barriers between traditionally siloed teams, development and operations. Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams work together across the entire software application life cycle, from development and test through deployment to operations.

## Why devops ?
Devops is used to improve the process of delivery . DevOps is all about bringing the development and operations teams together under one umbrella. By doing this, businesses can manufacture products and services faster than traditional methods. Apart from this, they can rectify errors and release updates at the earliest. This hybrid culture is gaining much traction primarily due to its efficiency. 

‚óè Quicker development time :

Before the arrival of DevOps, most organisations followed the conventional software development process. In the conventional process, the development and operations teams worked separately. This made it very hard to find whether the software is developed or not . 

‚óè Less Recalls and failures :
At times, a product deployment could fail due to faulty codes, and increased development cycles only make the problem worse. You can write more codes and release more applications by reducing the development cycle. Moreover, reducing the development time also gives you more time to review the codes, and you can spot errors quickly. 

‚óè Less cost :
With DevOps, the work is done efficiently, and then there is automation too. So, you won't need a lot of manpower to do the job anymore.
