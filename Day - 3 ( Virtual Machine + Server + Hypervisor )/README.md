# üìï Virtual Machine 

A‚ÄØVirtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual ‚Äúguest‚Äù machines run on a physical ‚Äúhost‚Äù machine.  Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC. 

Virtual Machine technology is used for many use cases across on-premises and cloud environments. More recently, public cloud services are using virtual machines to provide virtual application resources to multiple users at once, for even more cost efficient and flexible compute.  


# What are virtual Machines used for ?

Virtual machines‚ÄØ(VMs) allow a business to run an Operating system that behaves like a completely separate Computer in an app window on a desktop. VMs may be deployed to accommodate different levels of processing power needs, to run Software that requires a different operating system, or to test applications in a safe, sandboxed environment.


#  How do virtual machines work ?
The Virtual machine runs as a process in an application window, similar to any other Application, on the operating system of the physical machine. Key files that make up a virtual machine include a log file, NVRAM setting file, virtual disk file and Configuration file. 

# üîñ What is a Server ?
A server is a hardware device or software that processes requests Sent over a network and replies to them. A client is the device that submits a request and waits for a response from the server. The Computer system that accepts requests for Online files and transmits those files to the client is referred to as a ‚ÄúServer‚Äù in the context of the Internet.



## Uses of Servers
A client process may run on the same device. It can also connect over a network to a server to run on a different device. Examples of servers may include database servers, mail servers, print servers, file servers, web servers, application servers, and game servers. 

Most frequently client-server systems are implemented by the request-response communication., i.e., a client sends a request to the server. In this model, the server performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgement.

# üìí Hypervisor


A hypervisor is a form of Virtualization Software used in Cloud hosting to divide and allocate the resources on various pieces of hardware. The program which provides partitioning, isolation, or abstraction is called a virtualization hypervisor. The Hypervisor is a hardware virtualization technique that allows multiple guest operating systems (OS) to run on a single host system at the same time. A hypervisor is sometimes also called a Virtual machine Manager(VMM).
