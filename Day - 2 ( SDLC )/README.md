Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step.

The goal of the SDLC life cycle model is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the userâ€™s requirements. SDLC in software engineering models outlines the plan for each stage so that each stage of the software development model can perform its task efficiently to deliver the software at a low cost within a given time frame that meets usersâ€™ requirements.


## Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle

The SDLC model involves six phases or stages while developing any software. SDLC is a collection of these six stages, and the stages of SDLC are as follows:

## Stage-1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
Planning is a crucial step in everything, just as in software development. In this same stage, requirement analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from customer inputs, and sales department/market surveys. 


## Stage-2: Defining Requirements
In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 
This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle. 


## Stage-3: Designing Architecture
SRS is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document Specification (DDS). 

## Stage-4: Developing Product
At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS. Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set by the association. Conventional programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are also put into use at this stage. Some popular languages like C/C++, Python, Java, etc. are put into use as per the software regulations. 

## Stage-5: Product Testing and Integration
After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC. Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested. This ensures that the product confronts the quality requirements of SRS. 

## Stage 6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products
After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organizationâ€™s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment. It is important to ensure its smooth performance. If it performs well, the organization sends out the product as a whole. After retrieving beneficial feedback, the company releases it as it is or with auxiliary improvements to make it further helpful for the customers.
